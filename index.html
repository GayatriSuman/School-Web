          <p class="text-muted">Saint Francis Xavier, S.J. (born Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta, 7 April 1506–3
            December 1552), was a Navarrese-Basque Roman Catholic missionary, born in Javier (Xavier in
            Navarro-Aragonese or Xabier in Basque), Kingdom of Navarre (present-day Spain), and a co-founder of the
            Society of Jesus. He was a companion of St. Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took
            vows of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris in 1534.

            He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly in the Portuguese Empire of the time, and was influential in
            evangelization work, most notably in India. He also was the first Christian missionary to venture into
            Japan, Borneo, the Maluku Islands, and other areas. In those areas, struggling to learn the local languages
            and in the face of opposition, he had less success than he had enjoyed in India. It was a goal of Xavier to
            one day to reach India.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">A well stocked library is open to the pupils on all class days. It is also supplied with
            periodicals and magazines and is a veritable treasure house of reference books and encyclopedias. Each class
            is given a library period where the students are to read the books and make review of them.

            The reading of books is conducive to the formation of good mind and it is a source of general knowledge.</p>

            institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is
            a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and
            sometimes even to mourn collectively.</p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-xs-12">Eating habits continue to be a concern for parents
            around the world. It is essential that children eat well, but on more than one occasion, meals become a big
            battlefield. This generates anxiety and rejection, which can affect other aspects of our relationship with
            them.

            Enrolling our children in the school canteen is a possible solution to certain attitudes towards food. In
            addition, it offers many other benefits and the opportunity to preserve the relationship we have with them.

            The school canteen is a service provided by most schools and is integrated in the operation of these
            schoolsbecause they also understand that in these stages, nutrition and nutrition are of vital importance.
            In this article, we will analyze the benefits that these centers offer us, both on a personal and family
            level.</p>

            track of attendance of its students for purposes such as tracking student’s progress in terms of class-wise
            attendance and behavioral analysis.

            An online attendance management system for students eases the task of attendance taking besides helping
            schools manage data on real time basis.

            Aside from managing attendance, an online attendance system serves as an efficient tool of communication
            between students, teachers and parents for updating purposes as well.

            Online attendance system for students can be integrated with your existing virtual classroom software to
            manage grades, behavioral reports, timesheet, etc. Most such platforms help in maintaining attendance
            records based on class wise, day wise and subject wise basis</p>
